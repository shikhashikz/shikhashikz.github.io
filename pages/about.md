Hey there, I'm not your typical B2B Growth Marketing Leader – I'm more like your growth consultant! I'm all about diving into the exciting world of Go-To-Market strategies, cranking up Brand Awareness, and cooking up some seriously tasty Account-Based Marketing and Account-Based Experiences. Oh, and let's not forget about that Demand Generation magic I bring to the table.

But hey, here's the secret sauce to my success: I'm a firm believer in the power of collaboration. I'm not a lone wolf; I'm the leader of the "One Team Approach" fan club. I love rolling up my sleeves and working side by side with my fellow teams to make that revenue train go full steam ahead.

Now, here's where things get really interesting – I've been making waves in the marketing world. In 2023, I earned my stripes as a "CMO to Watch" according to the cool folks over at CMO Alliance. And if that wasn't enough, the World Marketing Congress crowned me the "Most Innovative Martech Leader."

But awards and titles aside, I'm not one to rest on my laurels. I'm always on the hunt for new knowledge, and you'll often catch me sharing my wisdom as a panelist at marketing events, whether they're virtual or in the flesh. I'm also a podcast guest, dishing out advice to fellow senior marketers.

And when you catch me chatting, you'll hear me waxing poetic about:

The epic journey to becoming a rockstar B2B Marketer and the secrets of the CMO roadmap.
Why CMOs are the unsung heroes of the C-Suite.
The game-changing power of collaboration and how it transforms businesses.
The sacred art of deep work – it's a game-changer, trust me.
CMRO – ever heard of it? Chief Marketing Revenue Officer, the next big thing.
Dive deep into the mysteries of ABM, ABX, GTM, and RevOps – the building blocks of marketing success.
So, what's my secret sauce? It's simple: I'm a relentless learner, and my motto is to keep Learning, Unlearning, and Relearning.
Let's chat about your growth plans and strategy.

*Tell me your Story!*
