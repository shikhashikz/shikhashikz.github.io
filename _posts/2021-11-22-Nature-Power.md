I find my strength in water, and the ever moving clouds.

Does not matter how dense or opaque the darkness is, light makes its way. It has the power to cut the chaos. Darkness does not have the strength to stop the light. Eventually, like a sharp knife, light pierces and shreds the darkness in such a way that after a while, we do not feel that the deep chasm inhabited the place.

Mountains reaffirms my belief that with strength and patience, I can achieve great heights.

This picture is very special to my heart. The reason being I have never witnessed such an amazing waterfall which is real but yet looks so unreal. Things which are divine are surreal and we keep on checking again and again to confirm its presence.

P.S. All these are raw unedited photos clicked by yours truly. There is no fun in spoiling nature's beauty by editing God's master stroke.
