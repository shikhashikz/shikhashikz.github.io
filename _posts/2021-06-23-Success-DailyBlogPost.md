Do I pave the way for my own Success?

>Yes, I am the creator of my own success. 
>
It’s on me how my path is charted. If I do not want to walk a particular path, then your pep talk will not help me. I strongly believe in Intrinsic Motivation. I believe that I will do it If I want to do it. And I will also make time to do it. 

I took a forward step in the journey and have signed up for [Peak Community](https://www.peak.community/)
