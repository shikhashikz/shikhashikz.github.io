 Picking the threads from my first book, Define 36 which was a collection of shortest ( flash) stories, my second work of Fiction, The Lift Saga, is a novelette. I have a long way to go before I will pen a full-fledged novel. Nevertheless, writing is meditation for me, and I have promised myself that I will never stop it.
