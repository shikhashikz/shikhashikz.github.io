 I turned 36 this year ( and I am not shy to reveal my age ). Initial months of 2016 was when I decided that it's high time that I put my personal goal into action, and I started working on this piece. When you are 18, you are free to take your decisions and venture into a new horizon.Probably for me, the second innings of 18 enabled me to work on my dream project. 
That's how this title came into being and the flash stories !
