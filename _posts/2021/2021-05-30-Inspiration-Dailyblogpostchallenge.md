In one of my recent **[Insta posts](https://www.instagram.com/novelistinaction/)**, I had highlighted what are the tips which are working for me to ace up my learning:

*✅ Follow the Experts in the subject of your interest*

*📚Read, what they are reading*

*🌟Attend the webinars and listen to the podcasts*

*✍️Capture your key takeaways in a post*

Adding the fifth one, you can not keep on looking for Inspiration every other day and re drawing your board. Once you have made a plan stick to it. As in my previous post, I did mention that there will be variations depending on how that day is unfolding, but more or less if there is a plan, it will pull you back to the basics.

I can not help sharing this post on the first initial wins from [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2018/10/the-first-1000-are-the-most-difficult/) 

Remember, **Cut the noise, Define your Plan and Stick to it!**
