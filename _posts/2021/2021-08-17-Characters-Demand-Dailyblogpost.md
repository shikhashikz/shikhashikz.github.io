Writing Trivia

>I did not come across characters in all the fables where they are discussing their existential/ spiritual needs. Itâ€™s always about either the physical needs or the longing to be with somebody who completes their life.
>

Have you read any book where the character is yearning to grow spiritually? Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead is one. Any other?
