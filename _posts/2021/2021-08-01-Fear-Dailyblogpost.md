Fear shuts us, and makes us blind to the realitya round us.

***When we are afraid, we do not see clearly…..I didn’t see what I wanted to see. I saw what I was afraid of seeing. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it’s almost impossible when we are scared. There’s no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.***
Hans Rosling in his book Factfulness.

Being in corporate circle, there is this constant fear of losing our job, which causes us to lose touch with the reality of what we can do, and what is our expertise and how we can build our path of constant learning. We are caught in that constant web of what if and our fear takes the monstrous shape which keeps us away from experimentation.
