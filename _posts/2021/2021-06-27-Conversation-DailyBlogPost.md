>How often do you speak to your kids?
>

âœ¨Have you shared your sorrows, your plans, your thoughts, your aspirations with them?

âœ¨Is it always coochy-coo or did you try to have a mature conversation with them?

I love talking to my kids about life, the challenges which I face in my everyday life, where do I get stuck, what do I love the most and some more similar topics like this. The best part in these conversations was: 

ðŸ’–There was no judging.

ðŸ’–They listened attentively.

ðŸ’–They acknowledged my feelings.

ðŸ’–When I finish my ramblings, I get a tight hug and if I am lucky and they are in a good mood, a kiss as well.
