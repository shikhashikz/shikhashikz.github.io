When was the last time did you celebrate your failures?

Mine are:

❇️ I did not get admission to the prestigious colleges of Delhi University.

❇️ I did not get admission to a post-graduate college after sending my application to 29 colleges. 

❇️ My first two books have been bought by less than ten people.

❇️ I did not get a placement when I passed from MBA.

❇️ I did not have a salary based structure for my first job. It was purely on incentives and I was not able to sell even one insurance.

💖 What I did was, I treated my failures as the stepping stone? All these failures were a big blow for me, but I was determined to turn the storm in my favour.
