From where should I derive Inspiration?

>Going through my previous posts, I realized that during my low moment, all I need to do is come back to the golden words which I have posted and there will be no dearth of motivation. ðŸ’¯
>

ðŸ’¡ And those words are my own words, which have sprung from the deep chasm, which portrays that my self-belief keeps me afloat. Every day is a struggle to keep my head high and not let myself drown in the delusional sorrows which my mind has created. I know I have the power to create a beautiful world. All I need to do is believe in myself. ðŸŒŸ
