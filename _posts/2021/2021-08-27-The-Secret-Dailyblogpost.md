Do you stay STRONG all the 365 days?

There is a spiritual way on how things work. If I pursued relentlessly the thing which I am wishing for, it shows a result in some or the other way. There are days when I am head over heels in love with “The Secret” and yes, there are days when doubt suddenly creeps in. I just need to make sure that those cracks do not become gigantic holes. 

> Need to keep going and treating each day as a new day. This thought, and with the unnerving attitude of an ant, will keep on fueling my strength.
