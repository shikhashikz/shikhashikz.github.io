>Do not lose your moment of Glory. Cherish it and freeze it in your heart.

In the end, or at least once in your lifetime, things are ok. You do experience that moment where you are at the pinnacle, and you do feel that this is it, this is that moment for which you were waiting for your entire life. You soak at that moment and do not want that moment to leave you forever. That feeling which you wanted to feel when you are at the pinnacle, or that moment for which you have put in practice many years, those moments are priceless.

And sometimes it does happen, that anxiety grips you so hard, that what happens at that moment goes off in a whoosh. And when that moment is over, you try so hard to go and revisit that moment again and again to feel it, but alas that does not come back. The moment once lost is lost forever.
I do have many moments like this where my anxiety was at the crux, or I was so busy in getting things done, that when I tried to recreate those scenes back, I see myself as an outsider whereas that moment belonged to me. It was my moment of glory and I had lost it forever.
