Give yourself the luxury to sitback, observe whats happening around and smile for a while. ðŸ¥°

>The coziness of the cushy sofa.
>
>Air filled with the aroma of the slow cooked food.
>
>Loud chatter of the kids.
>
>Constant snapping of fingers by the hubby.
>
>Mom officially ending the day with ardas.
>
>Warm lights created the mood for the night to descend.

***And there I was getting myself soaked in the atmosphere with the words from The Comfort Book.***

>What's your happy space?
