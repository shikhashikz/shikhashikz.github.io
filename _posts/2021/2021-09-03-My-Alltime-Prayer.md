📿 I have found my own little prayer which gives me power and strength in all the times, good times, bad times, down time, all the time! 🙏

🌏 ***Mother earth give me the power to stay grounded***

🌥️ ***Father sky I need your help to uplift me***

💧 ***Brother water please make me flexible and*** 
 
🔥 ***Sister Fire give me the energy to fuel my commitment to growth***
