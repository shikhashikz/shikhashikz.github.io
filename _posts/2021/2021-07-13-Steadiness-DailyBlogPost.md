"Nobody completes you. You‚Äôre not half. You don‚Äôt have to be perfect, but you have to come to a place of giving. Instead of draining anyone else, you‚Äôre nourishing them.

‚Ä¶until you heal the wounds of your past, you will continue to bleed. You can bandage the bleeding with food, alcohol etc, but eventually, it will all ooze through and stain your life."

Quotes from the book Think like a Monk.

„Ä∞Ô∏è I am generally either on a high tide or on a low tide. The steadiness of an ocean or the characteristic displayed by the Monks is what I am aiming for. Understanding why I am always on extremes is critical. The attachment with the outcome stirs these emotions. üåä

The concept of steadiness also reminded me of some of my mentors, who always have this calm and composed demeanour. This does establish the fact that I should enjoy the process, keep on working towards my goal and in that journey, I will achieve my milestones. I went further deeper in the concept and got it that the journey of self-learning, improving our self and creating Brand YOU never stop. Because it‚Äôs not like that, I have established my brand, now I can sit back and relax. Like writers, keep on writing, creators keep on coming up with new products or product enhancements in it, similarly, the path of self-learning which I have chosen does not have any destination. So logically, on this path, highs and lows do not matter, only what matters, I keep on walking.

üí° Tip: I have started practising it when I speak. Calm, composed devoid of many highs and lows!
