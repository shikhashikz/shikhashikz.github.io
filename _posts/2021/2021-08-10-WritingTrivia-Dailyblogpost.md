What are your Writing Trivias?...

I am full of gratitude when I can write and present my thoughts in words. I feel overwhelmed when the characters of my novel come to life in front of my eyes. The feeling is magical.

***So of course a little bit of writing trivia is allowed on my favourite subject***

ðŸ’¡ Sometimes I do go through the same emotions which my characters are going through

ðŸ’¡ Words which are bolded: Thereâ€™s nothing bold about it

ðŸ’¡ Writing is like food cooked on slow ignition. Let it simmer, let it retain the taste. Donâ€™t rush else all you will be left is ashes

ðŸ’¡ Writing is equivalent to self-discovery. Itâ€™s a journey worth taking

ðŸ’¡ The process of knitting a story and creating a character is magical. People call it a lonerâ€™s journey, but itâ€™s not as your characters never leave you alone!

ðŸ’¡ Anyone can write sitting on the beach, or engulfed by mountains, or locking themselves in a room. Real grit is when you can release the flow of words amid the chaos when you are being swallowed by the chasm but you maintain sanity with your sentences.
