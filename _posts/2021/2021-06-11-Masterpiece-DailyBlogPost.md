Humans need something tangible to prove their worth.

We love to showcase our trophies, don't we? It’s something we have earned and is a testimonial of our hard work. We put them on nice displays, regularly polish them and clean them.

Many times, we as parents think of our children as our masterpieces. We are the ones who have turned them into what they are today. Their present success is because of our hardships and the struggles which we went through. If there are any flaws in their lives, it’s because they have created them. It’s their wrongdoings. The one which we had created and aimed for was a perfect masterpiece. When our kids become parents, we do not trust them. They can not turn a masterpiece.

Human Fallacies and Superfluousness.
