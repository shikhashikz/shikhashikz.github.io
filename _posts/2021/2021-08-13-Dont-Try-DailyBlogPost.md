“Trying” to develop a habit, check what’s wrong with your approach. Probably you are always telling yourself, “I will try to do it. I am trying hard, but not able to get any results. Because in our hearts we know that we will not do it.”

In my experience:

***There is no Try. Either you do it or you do not do it.***

This is one of my favourite quotes. 

In my opinion, the word "Try" should be removed from the dictionary!

If I take my writing as an example, either I am making a conscious effort to sit and do it or I do not do it all. or say wiling away my time on Social Media. I was trying hard to break the habit but results were not coming. I had to remind myself, I will not do it! 

There is never a midway between. And that’s what determines success and failure (learning). Next time check yourself, before you utter the word, Try!
