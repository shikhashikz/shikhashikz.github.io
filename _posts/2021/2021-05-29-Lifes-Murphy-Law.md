Life has curves, it's never a straight lineâž°

Only ROBOTS follow straight linesðŸ¤–

No two seconds, minutes, hours, days are the same. They are always distinct from each other. They can be the mirror image but never the same. The routines are laid, followed to the core, but still, there are times when you carry on with the day slightly different. As no matter how good your day is going, there will always be that one thing that puts you off the trajectory. And if you had series of off the track happenings, one silver lining will always be your jackpot at the end of the day. Expecting that you can be bang on the way you have designed your calendar, is a myth. A minute here and there is acceptable and things will turn awry. Donâ€™t beat yourself too hard on that.
