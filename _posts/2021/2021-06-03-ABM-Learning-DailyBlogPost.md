My ABM learning pick for this week.

My journey with ABM learning is recent and in my five months of learning, I did not come across concepts like **ABM framework, ABM Center of Excellence and ABM Index.** I am going through the on-demand videos of ITSMA and came across Infosys' 2020 diamond award-winning program. After going through the 20+ minute of learning, I can relate to **Julie Schwartz’s** Enthusiasm when she talks about Infosys’s journey. The way **Navin Rammohan** represents how ABM efforts were crafted, drafted and relayed, gave me a high. Simple, no-nonsense approach, focusing on the core objective and making sure that the results are displayed. The **ABM Scorecard** will surely make you jump from your chair. My mouth was wide open when I was looking at the numbers and I was imagining how can I achieve this!

***Mind-blowing, highly recommended webcast, if you want to learn how Navin and Team implemented “Unmarketing”. He makes the entire process so simple (though I know how much work, collaboration, teamwork, extracting the insights from analytics would have gone into it) like applying butter onto bread.***

My key takeaways:

**•	ABM is Unmarketing**

**•	The 3 Pillars of Unmarketing Intervention**

*Personalize the Vision*

*Revolutionize the Experience* 

*Humanize the Relationship*

•	From 1 Pilot Account they scaled the efforts to Top 24 accounts within three years

•	ABM was used to change the perception of Infosys as a Traditional IT services company

•	The pipeline within the account significantly improved, and their score improved

•	Enhancing Reputation, Relationship Strength and Supporting Revenue which were drafted had specific OKRs

•	Take ABM from just measuring value to enabling and empowering decisions and actions

•	They have 12 ABMers each handling two accounts

•	How CSR was built-in in the ABM initiatives, truly remarkable. As Navin says, ABM should be done without any force, it should come as naturally, it should not be something imposed but should bring a human face to marketing
