My takeaway for today came early in the morning while reading Stephen King’s Writing Memoir:

>“If God gives you something you can do, why in God’s name wouldn’t you do it?” 💯

*“Once I start work on a project, I don’t stop and I don’t slow down unless I absolutely have to. If I don’t write every day, the characters begin to stale off in my mind- they begin to seem like characters instead of real people. The tale’s narrative cutting edge starts to rust and I begin to lose my hold on the story’s plot and pace. Worst of all, the excitement of spinning something new begins to fade. The work starts to feel like work, and for most writers that is the smooch to death. Writing is at its best-always, always, always- when it is a kind of inspired play for the writer. I can write in cold blood if I have to, but I like it best when it’s fresh and almost too hot to handle.”* (Quoted from Stephen King's book)

***Time to bring the editing of my manuscript to close so that I can get going with Part 2 of #knowsamisha.*** ✈️
