Either I have to start using a stopwatch or ditch the clock altogether!!

>*Time Please slow down*
>

>*You are not in sync with the ideas flowing in my mind*
>

>*My passion and Creativity are at the perfect amalgamation*
>

>*I do not know if there will be a tomorrow*
>

>*I want to pour out all thatâ€™s in my head*

***These are some of those days when I feel like a Marketing Genius and my head is constantly bombarded with amazing ideas to scale up***
