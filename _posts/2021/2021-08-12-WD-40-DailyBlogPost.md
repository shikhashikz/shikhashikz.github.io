Raise your hand if you know what ***WD-40*** stands for! 

I did not know about it until I had to Google Search it. I was wondering how come it has come from Ann Handley and what it has to do with writing. I mean writing and WD-40. What’s the relation?

WD stands for Water Displacement and Norm Larsen, the founder of the product tried 40 times to get the product right! WD-40 was founded in 1953 and is still in use today. [You can read the history here.](https://www.wd40.com/history/) I would love to hear your views on how you correlate WD-40 and writing!

My views on WD-40 and writing:

•	Polish, Polish till it shines. That’s what Norm Larsen did. He did not lose hope and tried, tried till he succeeded. As Ann Handley and Stephen King say: ***the only way you can sharpen your writing skills is by sitting and writing!***

o	Underlying danger: Nothing is perfect, don’t take this as a reason, that because I do not find my work good enough, hence I did not publish my last 100 posts!

•	What does WD-40 (the product) stand for? [It has thousands of uses and gets the job done right.](https://www.wd40.com/products/) The underlying fact is it removes the dirt/ or any other unwanted material. Don’t shy away from editing, and get the “extra” words out. Be plain but not pompous.

Keep reading, keep writing and keep editing! Get your *bottle* of WD-40 out!
