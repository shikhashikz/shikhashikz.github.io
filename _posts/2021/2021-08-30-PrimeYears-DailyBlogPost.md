ðŸ‘µ Have you pictured your old life? Hope you are not ignoring that phase and turning a BLIND EYE to it! ðŸ‘µ

ðŸ¥Œ What are the two things which will define your prime years? (Your 50s, 60s, 70s) What is that clear and not so obvious thing which you want to appear in the photo frame of your birthday shoot when you have hit this milestone 50/60/70 healthily and heartily? ðŸŽ·

>My only wish for what I want from my old age is: Financial freedom and no acerbic nature. Those two things will keep my world sane.

>I am going to do a reality check (coming back to this post) when I am at 50/60 or if I am alive when I am 70!
