Is your world crowded in celebration, and lonely in desolation?

*Who was standing with you when your world was falling?*

*Who was standing with you when you could not muster your guts?*

*Do you remember those people who were standing with you when you were in a mess and in your lowest ebb or those who only showed up to celebrate your success?*

*Do we remember our highs more or sulk in the lows day in and day out?*

*The tides like the time never stay the same: there are highs and lows. **What stays with us is; when the tide leaves, whatâ€™s and who is left behind.***
