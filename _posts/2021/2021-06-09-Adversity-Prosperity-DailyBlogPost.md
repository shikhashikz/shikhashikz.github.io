**Adversity** and **Prosperity** always ***Create Amazing Stories.*** 

Because this is where reality lives; when adversity wants to meet the prosperity and prosperity wants to meet the adversity. They attract each other like magnets. You will never find any story which is *only* full of adverse situations or where the characters are *always* enjoying prosperous lives. Imagine the Tom and Jerry chase, it’s similar in our fictional and real stories as well, where the circle of life does not get completed without both of them. It’s a loop where adversity and prosperity keep on chasing each other. 

***Think about your life, dark clouds never stayed forever, a silver lining was bound to penetrate it. Sunshine did come*** 🌥️
