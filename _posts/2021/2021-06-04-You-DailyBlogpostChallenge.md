Who holds the reins? 

*GOD, your family, your friends, your colleagues, society or is that ***YOU?***

I would like to quote **Henry Ford’s** famous quote: *Whether you think you can, or think you can’t- you are RIGHT.”*

I came across this quote in **Angela Duckworth’s Book- Grit** and also these lines from Grit.

*“When you keep searching for ways to change your situation for the better, you stand a chance of finding them. When you stop searching, assuming they can’t be found, you guarantee they won’t”*

Doesn’t this sum it all on who has the reins of our life? We keep on blaming so many things, circumstances, our situation, however in the end it’s all about us. You will only go as far you find the road. If you think that’s the end of the road, so be it. But if you stretch a little bit, you never know what kind of wonders you will discover or how it will enrich you in your learning experience.
