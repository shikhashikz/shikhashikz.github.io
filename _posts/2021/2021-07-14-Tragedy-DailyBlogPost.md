Is it the happiness or a tragedy which brings us really closer to each other? Which one reminds us of our core values?

When nature wants to bring everybody together, a tragedy is what is struck out. Isnâ€™t it true when the happy vibes are there, people tend to get jealous and stray away? They might be there with you, but maybe not 100%. Is a tragedy needed to bring everyone together? Are we more inclined towards grief? It's confusing. Connections who provide us unconditional support are the ones for whom times do not matter.
