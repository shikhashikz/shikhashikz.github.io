Sometimes I fall short of notebooks to capture the key takeaways!

**[In continuation with my previous post](https://shikhashikz.in/Marketing-Trivia-Post1/)**

11.	Before launching ABM program, all the parties should agree on the required metrics
12.	Do not sign off Direct Mail. Off late, I am seeing many posts where marketers are talking about this "forgotten" tactic and sharing the success which they had in their ABM programs
13.	Keep your target accounts engaged with content. You should be in front of them even when they are not contemplating for a purchase
14.	Delivering valuable information without an ask
15.	ABM gets a rebranding with ABX, establishing further that success of an ABM can only occur with “One Team” concept.Experience across all teams
16.	If you slip up on Better Marketing, this will become one of your Top five reasons for failure
17.	There is no shying away from Demand Gen programs. You got to prioritize them
18.	Throw your selling pitch in the bin, start focusing on industry problems
19.	Though contact enrichment is a strenuous cycle, but this is one which will pay off in a longer run
20.	Prime time to stop cringing about the marketing budget. Get the rabbit out of the hat, and let’s see how you can think, act differently to be on the winning side
