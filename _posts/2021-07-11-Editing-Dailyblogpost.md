Editing is a mean task. I can lay bets on that.

This is my second round of editing my manuscript and I am sure something good will come out. As my first round of self-editing did open my eyes!

💡 Editing your work is a big challenge.

☘️ It’s a big ego mellowing down exercise.

📑 All the writers should read their work as a reader and then be as cruel as they can be to the written word.

♦️ So that in the end which comes out is pure gold.
