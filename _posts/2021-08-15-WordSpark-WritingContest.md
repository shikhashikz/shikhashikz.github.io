We all love stories, now it's your chance to craft one! Don't be shy and shake the pen!!

In the spirit to ***promote reading and writing at an early stage,*** I have started a **writing contest**, named as **WordSpark.** ✨Why WordSpark, because word sparks that dormant force in us which is lying unexplored. Words are that force which has the power to move mountains. ⛰️

This is a project, which will run for a year and I plan to ***publish fifty stories as a part of Children's Anthology.*** There will be two parts of the anthology:

💖5-10-year-old: Collection of Fifty Stories 📚

💖10-15-year-old: Collection of Fifty Stories 📚

I am looking at submissions with minimum 500 words and there is no word limit for the maximum! I really want to see how the kid's imagination unfolds. Why I have kept it as a yearlong project as we know with kids, you can not ask them to pen a certain word limit in one sitting. They need to enjoy this activity.

>I have given one tip to my daughter: Start with the title, and just write one line every day. And viola within 12 months she will have 365 lines, if she will be
>regular at it. Talk about developing the habits!

And other age groups, don’t get disappointed, for the **age group of 15-20 years,** I will **feature Top ten stories on my website- www.shikhashikz.com**

Last but not the least, **20 & Above:** we will feature **One Story in each of the quarterly issue of WO-BRIGHT Magazine.** So for this one, we have a timeline. ***For the Dec issue, we would need the stories on/ before 15th October 2021!***

What are you waiting for! I am looking forward for your participation. Drop a note asap on- ***shikha@shikhashikz.com***
