Another goldmine from Peak, session with **[Daniel Englebretson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielenglebretson/) on Ludicrous Mode: 10 Lessons Learned Launching 24 ABM Programs In 12 Months.**

This is like a charter for ABM! It’s so normal that any campaign or new trend which a company adapts, they inch towards looking for quick-results, quick-wins etc. But like any other good things, ABM takes time. Daniel so aptly mentions that ***ABM team should not compete with their Demand Generation colleagues*** and the ***biggest misalignment is between Marketing and Marketing!*** Take your coffee, sit back and mull over these points. Daniel has gained these lessons over many years of his experience. Capturing them here:

💯 Don’t ruin the Honeymoon 💥

💯 Momentum is Key 💥

💯 It’s a war of attrition 💥

💯 Understand the next best action 💥

💯 Don’t take data shortcuts 💥

💯 Resist overcomplicating 💥

💯 Pace your martech 💥

💯 Always be learning 💥

💯 Don’t compete with yourself 💥

💯 Automation unlocks scale 💥
