>If you are a writer, maybe you will relate this with me.

*I mourn the death of so many words which I am not able to ink it, as,*

*They have been gulped by my subconscious,*

*I do go back and knock in those silent realms,*

*Which is like that endless ocean,*

*Where the water is still on the top,*

*And ruthless at the bottom,*

*But I still return empty handed.*
