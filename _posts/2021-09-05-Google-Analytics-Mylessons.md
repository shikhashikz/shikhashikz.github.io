Are you managing your personal website? How are you using Google Analytics?

You would have heard this before, but from me, it’s coming for the first time, ***“Google Analytics”*** is an amazing tool to know your audience! I am happy that I took a refresher course in GA4. It’s of immense help and since I have my website, and I have Google Analytics installed, but there is so much more which I can do with this tool. These points are like the mandate for me, that I need to keep my relationship intact with GA!

❓ What are your goals? Measure your goals and find areas for improvement.

⚔️ Know the vocabulary which GA4 uses as now everything is an “event”

🌟 Events are any interaction on the site are the backbone of GA. It’s completely event driven now

💯 Set up the goals! Really important.

💡 Source/ Medium can bring a lot of insights

🐤 Brush up on Attribution as you need to know who is getting the credit 

➡️ GA4 brings enhanced measurement, and the script needs to be on every page. Automated tracking with enhanced measurement with cross-device tracking and sessions being more robust.

🏃‍♀️ To experiment with the features by checking the “google analytics demo account”

💯 Google Tag Manager and Campaign URL builder are the topics which one should delve into after completing an overview of GA4

💥 Realtime reports are helpful when there is a big campaign launch as it gives a unique view of customers which you will not get otherwise

🔁 How do you get customers? That’s the very first reason we have acquisition reports and engagement reports shows you what exactly they are doing!

🌟 Analysis Hub and Pathing Analysis, other two important topics

💯 Do check Google Help section on Measurement Plan as from there you will get the framework to work around:

*Business Objectives, Strategies and Tactics, KPIs, Segments, KPI Targets*

***I believe understanding GA insights gives a great depth on your campaigns! I am keen to know-how are you using GA analytics for planning your content and targeting users for your personal website.***
