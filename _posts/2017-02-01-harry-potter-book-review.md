summary: My Favourite - Harry Potter book review
---

I love Harry Potter. Now this statement does not convey my feelings and how much regard I have for JKR. Let me try to say it one more time: I lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Harrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Pottttttttttttttttttttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I am little satisfied with the expression now and pray that the editor does not cut this piece off. After Voldermort, editors are the one who are capable of invoking the most dreadful feeling!

There will be an overdose of the word love in this review. So beware! It was amazing to enter Harry's house after almost nine years. The last book I had finished in straight one day and mind you with no break. I had shut myself in a room and if I recall I had hardly eaten that day and didn't even venture to the washroom. Such is the passion and love which I feel for Harry Potter and his amazing world.

I was not aware that this time the book will be in a play format. When I was reading the first few pages, I was wondering why the book is written like this and did the gap had made my love vanish away. True love is forever. I did not mind the acts and the scenes and entered deep in the forest. It was a fresh revision, when I used to finish Shakespeare's play within hours. Nothing mattered and all the characters were busy enacting their scenes in front of me. 

When my children will grow up, I am going to gift the entire series to them! JKR tops the list of my favorite authors. I am amazed the way she spins one story after another and each one just grips the reader mind. I have a secret desire to be as creative like her. ssshhhhhhhhh

My favorite lines from the book:
* *We don’t choose who we’re related to*
* *It’s tough to live with people stuck in the past*
* *The anger I can cope with,the fact he’s right is harder*
* *My father proved you don’t have to be grown up to change the wizarding world*
* *That’s the thing isn’t it? About friendships. You don’t know what he needs. You only know he needs it.*
* *I think you have to make a choice-at a certain point–of the man you want to be. And at that time you need a parent or a friend. And if you’ve learnt to hate your parent by then and then you have no friends.. then you’are  all alone. And being alone, that’s so hard. And it sent me to a truly dark place*
* *And there’s only one way to teach a loser-humiliation*
* *We haven’t become anything-we simply are as we are*
* *Sometimes costs are made to be borne*
* *Bravery doesn’t forgive stupidity. Always think. Think what’s possible*
* *I can forgive you for one mistake Harry, maybe even two, but the more mistakes you make, the harder to forgive you it becomes*
* *I am the new past. I am the new future. I am the answer this world has been looking for.*
* *There is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison; the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe*
* *They were great men, with huge flaws, and you know what–those flaws almost made them greater.*

A true Harry Potter fan will go and just grab the book. For them the reviews do not matter!
