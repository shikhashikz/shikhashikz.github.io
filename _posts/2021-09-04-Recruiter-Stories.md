Are there any incidents which have left a mark on you while you were deep in the job search?

The one which stands out for me is:

>Shout out to those recruiters who chase you like crazy for few days and then hide in the rabbit hole. This is the most pathetic approach and will leave a lasting bad impression about your organization.
>

***I am still thinking hard to recollect my best experience during the job search!!***
