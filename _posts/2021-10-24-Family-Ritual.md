Do you believe in Family Rituals? 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

>Do you have any family ritual which has brought the entire family closer? We follow Sunday as the “No Gadget” day! Only phones are allowed to pick and make urgent calls, otherwise there is no TV, XBOX and Alexa too. We have to switch on the lights on our own! LOL.

Have you instilled any family rituals? 💥

***PS: Since yesterday was a NO-GADGET day, hence this post is coming a day late!!! ❎🖥️😄
