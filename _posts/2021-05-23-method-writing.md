I am on this journey at present where I am conceptualising the character of Samisha and fine-tuning it. I felt that when I was writing different scenes of her life, I could feel the emotions through which she is going through. It was not that this happened once, but multiple times. Then, I also tried another way, I became the character Samisha, though making sure that Samisha does not start behaving like me! It‘s a unique way on how you be that character and succinctly keep her apart. I recalled how famous actors used *method acting* to bring authenticity to the character which they are playing. I thought that is there something called **Method Writing** too? And yes there is. Then another question followed me: when we are creating something, don’t we bring “method” in our real lives as well. As most of the time, we are not “We”, but “the other person who is defined by the society, workplace and so on.”

We have inculcated “method” subconsciously in every part of our life, and actors, writers, just use it at a higher frequency. Do you believe that there is a “method” in everything we do?
