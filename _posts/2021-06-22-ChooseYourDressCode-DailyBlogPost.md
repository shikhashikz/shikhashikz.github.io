Do you have a dress code? Why is that we go gaga over stuffed closets, and tons of hanging dresses. Isn’t it stressful to decide every day or on every occasion what to wear, and then rack our heads with the matching spree. Without realizing we have used an immense quota of our energy in this “trivial decision making”. Why do you think some of the famous leaders profess on selecting a dress code to free up your mind? It will be useful for you to search for Steve Job, Mark Zuckerberg and Arianna Huffington’s dress code.

Trust me you are not measured by if you are wearing a different dress on each single day of the year and how well meticulated you are with your dress. If you are someone who wants to extract maximum from each and every single waking minute, and is super focused if you are spending those minutes/ hours towards your goals, then you can easily fix your wardrobe. This has helped me a lot. I have picked two colors for summer and two colors for winters. Has made my life a lot easy. By choosing a color and style you can create your own style statement. I am on the path to do that.

A bit of anecdote: I was trying this for quite long but what got me going with this was ”how strongly this was represented in the book Think like a Monk”

It's all about developing a habit and sticking to it. *Cut, Define and Stick*
